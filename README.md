## General Information
### Case Study
Boom Bike is a automated bike-sharing system service provider for individuals to rent bikes on a short term basis for a price or free. It allows people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

### Business Objective
Model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 


## Conclusions
- Linear Regression model is used to predict the demand for bikes.
